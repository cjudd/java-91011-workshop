1. Run the jcurl.java file passing the URL to a website from the command-line without compiling it first.

NOTE: This is a handy class to have for debugging HTTP connectivity issues from a JVM context such as SSL/TLS certificate issues. https://www.cpclerk.co.summit.oh.us for example at the time of this writing has an invalid certificate.  

2. Make jcurler an executable script from the command-line.
